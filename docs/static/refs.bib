	abstract={High-entropy alloys (HEAs), containing several metallic elements in near-equimolar proportions, have long been of interest for their unique mechanical properties. &#xD;More recently, they have emerged as a promising platform for the development of novel heterogeneous catalysts, because of the large design space, and the synergistic effects between their components.&#xD;In this work we use a machine-learning potential that can model simultaneously up to 25 transition metals to study the tendency of different elements to segregate at the surface of a HEA.&#xD;We use as a starting point a potential that was previously developed using exclusively crystalline bulk phases, and show that, thanks to the physically-inspired functional form of the model, adding a much smaller number of defective configurations makes it capable of describing surface phenomena.&#xD;We then present several computational studies of surface segregation, including both a simulation of a 25-element alloy, that provides a rough estimate of the relative surface propensity of the various elements, and targeted studies of CoCrFeMnNi and IrFeCoNiCu, which provide further validation of the model, and insights to guide the modeling and design of alloys for heterogeneous catalysis.}
