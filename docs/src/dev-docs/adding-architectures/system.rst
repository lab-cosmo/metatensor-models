Using System
############

The :py:class:`metatensor.torch.atomistic.System` class represents an atomistic system.
It is a container for the atomic ``positions``, ``species``, and ``cell``. These three
attributes can be accessed as properties of the ``System`` object, and they are all
:py:class:`torch.Tensor` instances.

In addition, the ``System`` class can contain one (or more) neighbor lists.
