Adding new models
-----------------

This section contains a quick introduction to adding a new model to
``metatensor-models``. The following pages explain our model interface, as
well as how to interact with our data classes:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    interface
    capabilities
    dataset
    output
    system
    tensormap

You can also browse the source code of the existing models in the
``metatensor-models`` repository to get a better understanding of how
integration can be achieved.
