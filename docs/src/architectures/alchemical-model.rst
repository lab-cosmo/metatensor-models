Alchemical Model
=========

This is an implementation of Alchemical Model: a Behler-Parrinello neural network 
with SOAP features and Alchemical Compression of the composition space. This model 
is extremely useful for simulating systems with large amount of chemical elements.

Installation
------------

To install the package, you can run the following command in the root
directory of the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install .[alchemical-model]

This will install the package with the Alchemical Model dependencies.


Hyperparameters
---------------

The hyperparameters (and relative default values) for the Alchemical Model model are:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../src/metatensor/models/cli/conf/architecture/alchemical_model.yaml
   :language: yaml

Any of these hyperparameters can be overridden with the training parameter file.
