metatensor-models
-----------------

This is a repository for models using metatensor, in one shape or another. The only
requirement is for these models to be able to take metatensor objects as inputs and
outputs. The models do not need to live entirely in this repository: in the most extreme
case, this repository can simply contain a wrapper to an external model.
